### Introduction

This project has been assigned by the recruitment team of "Argonauts" as a "Coding Challenge" in order to complete in 48 hours. The main idea of this assignment was to create a public API that will allow users to randomly generate sensible output by generalizing patterns found in an input text. It took me about 10.5 hours in order to fully complete the whole project. I used Java to implement this lybrary.
